            <p>The Rodney King verdict of 1992 coincided with a history of racial issues, police brutality, the immediate consequence of which was the Los Angeles Riots. As shown in the article,“Business as Unusual,” from the UCLA Archive, various businesses and households were destroyed, and thousands of Angelenos found their livelihood decimated. A photography studio owner in south-central LA, having run the studio for just 4 months, found his studio burnt to the ground during The Riots; he had been earning $400 per week and had planned to insure his business soon. The loss of his studio forced him to give up his future jobs– losing out on a chunk of earnings. Many others found their stores pillaged by looters. The first act of looting set in motion a series of financial troubles for various owners as they struggled with mortgage, bills, and expenses after losing out on their source of income– their businesses. As years passed, investors injected millions into the rebuilding of various neighborhoods; however, many business owners had already lost their investment.</p>
